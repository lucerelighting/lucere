WAYS TO USE WOOD IN YOUR INTERIOR



Evo wood is a much loved building material. It has been used many years in the construction of houses and other buildings. For example, there is a wooden house from the 12th century that is still occupied, proving just how strong wood can be. 
Alongside this strength, wood has other very interesting properties.
It is very easy to use
Each type of wood has its own appearance and strength.
Wood is durable. For example, wood that bears the guarantees that it has been sourced in responsible management of woodland.
This strength in combination with the warm appearance of wood makes it the perfect material for decorating an interior. Wood can be used in a variety of ways in an interior.
Wooden floors
Wood in an interior often means wooden flooring. Wooden flooring provides a hint of luxury and extra warmth in your home. Oak planks which have been treated with a varnish or oil are usually used for wooden floor. The planks come in various thickness, lengths and widths. There are also special shapes available such as a pattern or combination.



Panelling
For many people, panelling sounds a little old fashioned. But this wooden wall covering can still be beautiful today. Panelling is especially stunning within countryside interiors. 


Wooden separating wall
Wood is ideal for creating a second wall. You can use vertical planks a few centimeters from one another to separate a living room and dining room. This allows you to create your own, special room while maintaining contact between both areas. We use this design in our own office and can therefore give confirmation to its success.


Wooden ceilings
In older houses, the first floor was supported by heavy, wooden beams. Renovators often choose to restore these beams and then highlight them in the interior.
But you may think that a wooden ceiling only works in a classic interior? Not at all, there are also solutions for modern styling enthusiasts, such as the wooden ceiling cladding.


Doors and stairs 
Unless they’re using glass, an internal door is usually made of wood. Some choose to finish internal doors with a layer of paint, while others let the stunning wooden structure shine through.
This also applies to stairs. A wooden stairway is very beautiful and low-maintenance. And with a defeat of paint, your old staircase can be given a complete makeover.

Furniture
Just like in the past, furniture is still usually made of wood. Just take a look at the wardrobes, sideboards and drinks cabinets etc in your own home. There is a good chance that they will be made of wood.
But wood comes in masses of colors, finishes and formats. Go for blank wood if you like the Scandinavian look or choose a sideboard for retro styling.


Decoration 
Finally, there are thousands, perhaps millions, of wooden decorative objects to choose from. There’s something for everyone: wooden frames, flower pots and many other things.
